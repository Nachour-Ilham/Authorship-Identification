**Authorship Identification : Racine & Corneille** 


The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying texts written by two famous French playwrights, Corneille and Racine. The analysis and classification of these texts are based on linguistic patterns and stylistic characteristics unique to each author. By harnessing advanced natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, we aim to provide a reliable and automated method for authorship attribution of a given text.


üìä **Data**

The data was collected from PDF files containing the works of both authors.


‚öôÔ∏è **Model**

Two classification models, Logistic Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF), were utilized. An optimization of hyperparameters was performed using cross-validation. The models were evaluated in terms of accuracy on the test data


üî¨ **Model Evaluation**

The evaluation results of this  models are as follows:

üîπ **Logistic Regression**
Accuracy: 81.5%

üîπ **Random Forest**
Accuracy: 66.5%

The model with the highest accuracy was chosen as the best model for author prediction.


In conclusion, This project showcases the effectiveness of **PySpark** in handling big data processing and machine learning tasks, enabling efficient and scalable analysis of textual data. The integration of PySpark has allowed us to harness the computational power of distributed computing and achieve accurate authorship attribution. Happy analyzing! ‚ú®
